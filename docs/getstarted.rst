Introduction
--------------

This Writeup is **ONE** Example of hosting `Plone`_, its based on `Debian`_.
There are lots of other ways to do it and lots of other different ideas about setups and
administration.

About Setups
-------------

It does not matter if you install a server for `Plone`_ or an other Application, use always consistent setups/installs.
You always should thing about longterm setups, so thing about the future, this will make it easier if you change or upgrade your 
Application.
Keep also in mind that you have to take care about Hardware failure and Disk space for example.

**You should always use:**

    - `raid`_
    - `lvm`_
