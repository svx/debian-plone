Deploying

There a lots of different and ideas ways to do deploying, I will not [yet] cover them, but just to give you an overview I 
will name a few of them.

Keep in mind that I like to prefer a split between Server and Application, that also means I split the deploying process.


Deploy Tools
-------------

Lets start with a short overview, of course that are not all Tools/Possibilities:

    `Puppet`_

    `Fabric`_
    
    `Chef`_
    
    `CFEngine`_
    
    `Slaughter`_
    
    `Salt`_
    
    `Batou`_
    
    `Distribution Packages`_
    
    `Hostout`_

    `Cuisine`_

As I said there are more ways to to deploys, like for example Images, Snapshots and so on and so on, it also depends on your Infrastructure, your needs, your knowledge, and what you like or not...

Most of the time it is a good idea to pick one, which is often used in the community and still active under development.
